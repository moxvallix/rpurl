# ResourcePackURL
Minecraft plugin that retrieve Resource pack from a URL in a config

This plugin has been forked by Moxvallix, to add a random number to the end of the download URL.
This fixes a bug where Minecraft won't download updated resource packs from the same URL.

I also added the `/rp` command, to refresh textures on the fly.

Download the plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/moxvallix/rpurl/releases).
